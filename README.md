# AssetFlow — Employee Inventory Management System

A full-stack web application for managing company assets (laptops, monitors, phones, accessories) with an **event-driven** architecture — all asset status is derived from an `asset_events` table, never stored directly.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v18+
- **MySQL** v8+ running locally
- A MySQL database named `employee_inventory`

npm run migrate

# Seed default admin + sample data
npm run seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

> Backend runs on **http://localhost:5000**

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server

## Business Rules

- ✅ Asset status is **always derived** from the latest event — never stored directly
- ✅ An asset can only be allocated if its current status is **in_stock / returned**
- ✅ The **same asset cannot be allocated twice** (checked before creating event)
- ✅ Returns are only allowed if the asset is **currently allocated**
- ✅ Damage description must be **minimum 20 characters**
- ✅ Serial numbers must be **unique** (enforced at DB level)
- ✅ Allocation history is **never overwritten** — every action is a new event row
